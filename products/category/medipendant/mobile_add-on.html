<p style="text-align: left;">The 911 Everywhere device is an add-on to the traditional PERS Medical Alert and the Medipendant 2-way voice system and the AmberSelect Fall Detection. It can be worn as a necklace or placed in a pocket. The 911 Everywhere is used when a person leaves the house and can be used at the shopping mall, while driving, out on a hike, etc... In this way, you are always protected.&nbsp;<br /><br />The 911 Everywhere works on all cellular networks and you simply press a button to speak to emergency operator wherever you happen to be. This device allows unlimited use without incurring airtime charges. Simply charge the device once every three months (or after a use). This device is small, lightweight and fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. If you have any questions, feel free to give one of our experienced Medical Alert representatives a call.</p>
