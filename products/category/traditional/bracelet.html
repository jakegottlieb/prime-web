<h1>Emergency Medical Alert Bracelets</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="Medical Alert Bracelet - Far Range" height="171" src="/images/medical_alert/bracelet.gif" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px;" title="Medical Alert Bracelet" width="150" />The bracelet personal transmitter is a small device that travels with you in your home. The medical alert bracelet is waterproof, allowing it to be used in the shower.&nbsp;<br /><br />The bracelet provides security for its wearer at all times. The bracelet is designed to be a small, comfortable, and an unobtrusive addition to the medical alert system.&nbsp;<br /><br />The transmitter has an extremely long range and will work inside your home as well as the front and backyards of most houses. Pressing the button on the transmitter sends a digital coded wireless signal to the&nbsp;<a href="/products/category/traditional/medical_alarms/">main medical alarm unit</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Every two hours the transmitter tests for a low battery. If the battery tests low, the transmitter&rsquo;s red indicator will blink slowly and a low battery signal will be sent. A new transmitter will be shipped well before the life of the battery expires (the battery lasts approximately 5 years).&nbsp;<br /><br />Our medical alert bracelets are the highest quality. The bands are made of hypoallergenic materials and can be adjust to fit the users wrist no matter the size. For those with smaller wrists, we have a special emergency bracelet. If custom sized alert bracelets are needed, please notify one of our professionals and they will be more then happy to assist you. The bands are gender neutral and we carry both medical alert bracelets for men and for women.</p>
