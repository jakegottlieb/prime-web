<h1>Medical Alert Necklaces</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /><img alt="Medical Alert Necklace" height="150" src="/images/medical_alert/necklace.jpg" style="float: left;" title="Medical Alert Necklace" width="150" />The necklace, like the <a href="/products/category/traditional/bracelet/">medical alert bracelet</a>, is a small device which travels with you. It includes an adjustable nylon neck cord with a breakaway release. The&nbsp;necklace can be worn underneath most clothing and is our most popular medical alert addition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The transmitter has an extremely long range and will work inside your home as well as the front and backyards of most houses. Pressing the button on the transmitter sends a digital coded wireless signal to the&nbsp;<a href="/products/category/traditional/medical_alarms/">main medical alarm unit</a>.<br />Every two hours the transmitter tests for a low battery. If the battery tests low, the transmitter&rsquo;s red indicator will blink slowly and a low battery signal will be sent. As soon as a medical alert signal is received, we will you send a replacement transmitter at no cost. The battery will last for approximately 5 years.</p>
