<h1>Elderly Medical Alert Panic Button For Seniors</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="Elderly Medical Alert Panic Button for Seniors" height="181" src="/images/medical_alert/help-button.gif" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px;" title="Elderly Medical Alert Panic Button for Seniors" width="150" />The 'Help Button' is a supervised water-resistant emergency alarm transmitter; designed for use with the main medical alert unit. This transmitter features a large, easy to find, bright red 'HELP' button. Pressing the button activates the transmitter and sends a digitally coded wireless signal to the&nbsp;<a href="/products/category/traditional/medical_alarms/">main medical alarm unit</a>. A non-labeled aqua colored button is also included with the transmitter for alternative usage.<br /><br />The transmitter can be wall mounted using the snap-on mounting bracket, or simply be placed on a table. Four rubber "feet" are supplied for table-top use.<br /><br />With so many options and add-ons, it is hard to decide whether or not you need a mounted medical alert button. The standard medical alert button for seniors is great in the form of a <a href="/products/category/traditional/bracelet/">bracelet</a> or <a href="/products/category/traditional/necklace/">necklace</a>, but is it worth taking the chance of not being protected in all rooms of the house during a bad situation. This is not just an elderly panic button available for seniors; people of all ages place these around their houses to protect against the unexpected.</p>
