<h1>Smoke Detector</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="Picture of a smoke detector to go with our Traditional PERS medical alert." height="200" src="/images/medical_alert/smoke-detector.jpg" style="float: left; padding-right: 5px;" title="Smoke Detector" width="200" />The Supervised Photoelectric Smoke Detector is a UL listed photoelectric smoke alarm with a built-in transmitter designed for use with our Traditional PERS receiver. When smoke is detected, the alarm sounds a loud local alarm. Twenty seconds after the local alarm sounds, the built-in transmitter sends a digitally coded wireless signal to the Traditional PERS receiver. The Traditional PERS dials out and notifies our certified EMT operators that action is necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Depending upon the situation and the instruction provided, we can notify the client and dispatch the fire department directly if no response or if the client instructs us to; we can also notify any emergency contacts depending upon the instructions provided to us during setup.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A loud siren goes off on the main medical alert unit and an 85 dBA sounder is triggered from the smoke detector&nbsp;to ensure the client is aware of the signal received &nbsp;The wireless signal will be repeated every 20 seconds as long as smoke is still present.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We recommend at least one smoke detector and many of our clients have multiple detectors in the different rooms of their house.&nbsp;</p>
