The box has a combination that will be given to first responders in the event of an emergency, allowing them to retrieve the house key and enter the house without damaging the front door.&nbsp;<br /><br />After purchase, the lockbox can be delivered through the mail and arrives ready to go. We would encourage those customers particularly concerned about in home falls to purchase a lockbox and avoid the possibility of expensive home repairs.</p>
