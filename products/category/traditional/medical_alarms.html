<h1>Medical Alarm Main Unit</h1>
<p><img alt="Medical Alert Main Unit" height="150" src="/images/medical_alert/main-unit.gif" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px;" title="Medical Alert Main Unit" width="150" />Prime Medical Alert systems have two basic components, the console or base unit, and the personal transmitter device. The base unit&rsquo;s purpose is to house the receiver and voice amplifier that allows the customer to communicate with a 911 operator wherever they are in the house. The base unit has a range of 600 feet (approximately 36,000 square feet), which allows it complete coverage in the largest of homes.<br /><br />The base unit is easy to use, with an emergency button, and a cancel button, allowing the user to cancel the connection in the case of a false alarm. A loud alarm sounds immediately after the transmitter is pressed, letting the user know the main unit received their meidcal alarm signal.&nbsp;<br /><br />This system can be installed within minutes, simply requiring a phone and power cord be plugged into the wall sockets. A representative is available 24/7 in the event help is needed during the installation process. In the event of a power outage, the unit has a battery, which keeps it running for 36 hours.</p>
