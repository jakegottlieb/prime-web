We send out all three attachments giving our customers the option to switch between the&nbsp;<a href="/products/category/traditional/bracelet/">medical alert bracelet</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/products/category/traditional/necklace/">medical alert necklace</a>&nbsp;and belt clip at any time.&nbsp;<br /><br />This option is popular for those not interested in actually wearing the button The medical alert belt clip is great for day-to-day activities around the house such as gardening and washing the car. The belt clip provides a more accessible means to press the button than just placing it in a pocket. Although most of our customers enjoy the other options, it is great for those that prefer not or cannot wear the transmitter around their wrist or neck.&nbsp;<br /><br />As with the other options, it is extremely sleek, lightweight and has the same long range. Feel free to try out each one and choose your favorite.</p>
