<p style="text-align: left;">The Traditional PERS is one of the best selling home medical alert products of all time. There are millions of users in the United States and around the world. With this device, the user simply presses their <a href="/products/category/traditional/necklace/">medical alert necklace</a> or <a href="/products/category/traditional/bracelet/">medical alert bracelet</a> and a signal is transmitted to the base unit. This signal is then intercepted by our UL Certified Monitoring Center. An EMT responds and speaks over the base unit. Since we dispatch directly an do not go through 911 again; this process is very quick and effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Supervised transmitters regularly send status reports to the Console and low battery reports when their batteries are low. When the Console receives a low battery report, the TROUBLE indicator flashes. If the Console fails to receive a status report from a transmitter for a period of 24 hours, the TROUBLE indicator will light. All supervisory conditions can sound a&nbsp;local annunciation and be reported to our EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) certified operators.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Activity monitoring is another optional feature. With activity monitoring the client checks in daily either through a motion detector or by pressing the home button. If the client does not trigger the activity button (or motion detector), our operators our notified and attempt to call the client. If no response we follow the predesignated plan of action and can either call emergency contacts or dispatch directly.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">When a&nbsp;user has an actual emergency, time is of the essence. As with all of our other units, the user can have unlimited emergency contacts, medical information (i.e. medications, hospital of preference, primary care physician, allergies, etc...), and anything else relevant to assisting the client in the distressed situation. Feel free to give on of our professionals a call to help you with any questions you may have on our alarm products.</p>
