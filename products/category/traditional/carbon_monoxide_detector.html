<h1>Carbon Monoxide Detector (CO)</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="Carbon Monoxide detector for Fall Detection Medical Alert" src="/images/medical_alert/carbon-monoxide-detector-amber.jpg" style="float: left; padding-right: 5px;" title="Carbon Monoxide Detector" />The Supervised Photoelectric Carbon Monoxide detector is a UL listed photoelectric smoke alarm with a built-in transmitter designed for use with our AmberSelect receiver. When carbon monoxide (CO) is detected, the alarm&nbsp;sounds a loud local alarm.&nbsp;A sophisticated microprocessor receives data from a sensor, calculates the CO level and leak duration, and provides an alarm before dangerous CO levels are present.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because CO is a colorless, odorless and tasteless, yet very toxic gas that is produced when household heating and cooking fuels are not fully burnt up, quick identification of a leak is vital. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Built into the CO detector is a loud alarm buzzer (95db) and a large flashing LED alarm. The main unit dials out and our operators notify the client and local authorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We recommend at least one CO detector and many of our clients have multiple detectors in the different rooms of their house.&nbsp;</p>
