<h1 class="history">Our History...</h1>
<h3>How Prime Medical Alert Started</h3>
<p>Prime Medical Alert began in 2005 when William Campbell and Edward Gibson had the idea of bringing something new to the Medical Alert industry. Slowly, through customer retention and referrals, we expanded from state to state, growing into the company we are today. Prime Medical Alert was founded on the premise of offering the highest quality alarm products at the lowest prices.</p>
<p>As of now, Prime Medical Alert works with customers throughout the entire United States and Canada. We strive to provide the friendliest and most professional service in the business!</p>
<h3>Breakthrough Technology</h3>
<p>The Prime Medical Alert product line includes products manufactured by Linear, Medipendant and SurePod. Since we are offering the same products as many of our competitors we are able to extend you the <strong>best quality at a much lower price</strong>. We employ certified EMT (Emergency Medical Technicians) who have a minimum college requirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you are looking for we have it all: Whether you are looking for the standard medical alarm (Traditional PERS), the alarm with the speaker built into the bracelet or necklace (Medipendant), or a GPS Alert Device (SurePod), we have it all.</p>
