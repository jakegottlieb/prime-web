<h1>Frequently Asked Medical Alert Questions</h1>
<div class="clearfix">
<p><strong>Q: Will a Prime Medical Alert work in my hometown?</strong></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;"><br /></span>A: Yes, we provide medical alert service to the entire United States.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q: Can I install a Medical Alert system myself? What do I have to do?</strong></p>
<p>A: We have a&nbsp;<a href="/who-we-are/setup/" title="Medical Alert Setup Guide">medical alert installation guide</a>&nbsp;on our website. We are also able to provide personal assistance over the phone to customers who wish to install their alarm devices themselves.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q: When I sign up for a Medical Alert, what are my obligations? Is there some kind of contract?</strong></p>
<p>A: We do not charge for medical alert activations or the equipment. Instead, there are different payment options; there are no startup/activation or equipment fees either. It is worth noting our customers rarely cancel our service and all it takes is a phone call.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q: How does Prime Medical Alert make sure that my device is working?</strong></p>
<p>A: Our medical alert systems are tested weekly by operators at our call center. Personal alert devices are designed to notify us when their batteries are low, allowing us to replace them well before they run out of battery. Self testing is not necessary but encouraged for those who would like additional peace of mind.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q: How much longer does it take for Prime Medical Alert to call the first responders than if I called 911?</strong></p>
<p>A: No additional time is needed for the medical alert operators. As certified 911 alarm operators, our call center dispatches first responders just as your local 911 desk would.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q: How long will it take for a Medical Alert system to be delivered and activated?</strong></p>
<p>A: The shipping time is approximately 2-days in well populated areas and 3 in rural areas. If you are an Arizona resident, the shipping takes one day (in some cases we can do same day drop-offs and installation). We recognize that our customers are eager to get their medical alerts installed, and we move as quickly as we can to get them set up.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q: What kind of training does the emergency Medical Alert operator staff receive?</strong></p>
<p>A: Prime Medical Alert personnel, in addition to being Security Industry Association (SIA) certified, are drawn from a highly-trained corps of operators and staff who have completed six weeks of intensive training, have additional training and experience in Two-Way Voice monitoring and are certified as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT).</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q: Do you have Spanish speaking emergency Medical Alert operators?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, there are always Spanish speaking emergency operators on staff.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q: (For Corporate Customers) I am interested in incorporating Prime Medical Alert products into our business. What kind of agreements and services can you offer?</strong></p>
<p>A: During our time in business, Prime Medical Alert has formed a number of alarm partnerships. Please call our offices during your business hours so that we can find out what we can do for you.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q: How many times can I use the Medical Alert? Will I be charged extra?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can use it as many times as you want for no additional fee. There are no additional charges associated with frequent use.</p>
